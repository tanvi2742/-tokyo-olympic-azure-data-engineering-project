# -tokyo-olympic-azure-data-engineering-project
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **data pipeline** to collect and process **5 different Olympic datasets**, enabling streamlined access for analysis and reporting. The pipeline leverages **Azure Data Factory** for orchestration, **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** for centralized storage, and **Azure Databricks (PySpark and Python)** for scalable data transformation and enrichment. Optimized transformations ensure that the data is clean, reliable, and analysis-ready, while **Azure Synapse Analytics** provides a powerful platform for querying and deriving insights. By integrating these technologies, the project delivers high-quality datasets that empower stakeholders with actionable insights, supporting data-driven decision-making.
